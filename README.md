Creating presentation slides by using Beamer in LaTeX. [[What is Beamer in LaTeX?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX))]

### Beamer Examples

[**Example 1**] Social learning (background & example)

<p align = "center">
<img align = "middle" src = "https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-beamer/blob/main/example/social-learning/slide1.png" width = "400" />
<img align = "middle" src = "https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-beamer/blob/main/example/social-learning/slide2.png" width = "400" />
</p>

If you want to reproduce these slides on [overleaf.com](overleaf.com), please follow these steps:

- Upload the file `slide.tex` (check out `slide.tex` at [here](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-beamer/blob/main/example/social-learning/slide.tex)).
- Upload the image folder `../social-learning/images/` (check out the folder at [here](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-beamer/tree/main/example/social-learning/images), please upload all images).
- Recompile `slide.tex` on your Overleaf project.
